I got assignment in college on fourier transform.
I wrote the matlab code on that.

Q1. Write an inbuilt MATLAB function for calculating Fourier transform of continuous-time
signal x(t)..

Q2. Write a MATLAB program to find Fourier transform of x(t) = 0.9e^j(pi)t/3, 0< t < 10, and
also plot the magnitude and phase.

Q3. Use MATLAB to find the spectrum of x(t)
x(t) = 1/(a^2 + t^2).

Q4. Consider
x(t) ={	1, 0 < t < 3
	  {	0, otherwise
Use MATLAB to find Fourier transform and plot both the amplitude and phase of the spectrum.

Q5. Consider two random signals x1(t) and x2(t) which are uniformly distributed over the
interval [0, 1] over 0 < t < 10. Verify the linearity property of Fourier transform and plot the
necessary waveforms with MATLAB.
